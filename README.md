# Project Design

## Objective
The objective of our project is to build a web app that helps students **study together in groups**, **chat in real-time**, and **quiz each other**. Our app is structured to allow students to connect, discuss, and reinforce their knowledge. The app promotes interactive learning through the following three main features:

### Study Groups
When first arriving on the website, the user will create an account and log in. After that, the user can head to the **“Study Group”** section, where they will be prompted to join an existing group with a code from the group creator or start a new group themselves. These groups let the user connect with other students who are studying similar topics, and they can leave the group at any point.

### Chat Rooms
Once in a study group, users can go to the group’s main page, which has a **public chat** feature. On this page, users can see old messages, check out who’s in the group, and start chatting using the chat box function. The chat room lets them send messages that everyone in the group can see instantly.

### Quizzes
From the main page or the study group page, the user can go to the **“Quizzes”** section, where they can either make a quiz or join one that’s already been shared with the group. If the user decides to make a quiz, they can add questions and answers, save it, and upload it to the group for others to try. When joining a quiz, they get to choose from all quizzes that have been previously uploaded to the group and answer questions in real-time. After finishing the quiz, the user can see and compare their score with other members.
